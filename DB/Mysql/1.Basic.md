## üöÄ Getting Started with MySQL

This section will guide you through setting up your MySQL environment.

  * **Install MySQL Server & Client:**
      * **What it is:** MySQL Server is the database itself, and the client is what you use to interact with it (like a command-line tool or a graphical interface).
      * **How to:** Download and install the MySQL Community Server from the official MySQL website ([li√™n k·∫øt ƒë√°ng ng·ªù ƒë√£ b·ªã x√≥a]). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). During installation, you'll set a root password ‚Äì remember it\!
      * **Example (Windows):**
        1.  Go to the MySQL Downloads page.
        2.  Select "MySQL Community Server."
        3.  Download the MSI Installer.
        4.  Run the installer and follow the prompts.
  * **Choose a Client Tool:**
      * **What it is:** While the command-line client is built-in, a GUI tool can make learning easier.
      * **How to:**
          * **MySQL Workbench:** Official GUI tool from Oracle, excellent for beginners. It's often bundled with the MySQL installer.
          * **DBeaver:** A universal database tool that supports many databases, including MySQL.
          * **DataGrip (JetBrains):** A powerful commercial IDE for databases.
      * **Example:** For this guide, we'll assume you're using **MySQL Workbench**.

## üß± Database Fundamentals

Understanding these core concepts is crucial for working with any relational database.

  * **Databases:**
      * **What it is:** A container for tables, views, stored procedures, etc. Think of it as a folder for related information.
      * **Example:** You might have a database named `company` to store all information related to your company's operations.
  * **Tables:**
      * **What it is:** Where your actual data is stored in rows and columns.
      * **Example:** In the `company` database, you might have tables like `employees`, `departments`, and `projects`.
  * **Columns (Fields):**
      * **What it is:** Individual categories of data within a table. Each column has a specific data type.
      * **Example:** The `employees` table might have columns like `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `hire_date`, `salary`.
  * **Rows (Records):**
      * **What it is:** A single entry or record in a table, containing data for each column.
      * **Example:** A row in the `employees` table could be: `(101, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2023-01-15', 60000)`.
  * **Primary Keys (PK):**
      * **What it is:** A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique.
      * **Example:** `employee_id` in the `employees` table.
  * **Foreign Keys (FK):**
      * **What it is:** A column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between them.
      * **Example:** In a `projects` table, `employee_id` could be a foreign key linking to the `employees` table, indicating which employee is leading a project.
  * **Data Types:**
      * **What it is:** Specifies the type of data a column can hold (e.g., numbers, text, dates).
      * **Common Examples:**
          * `INT`: Whole numbers.
          * `VARCHAR(length)`: Variable-length string of characters.
          * `TEXT`: Longer text strings.
          * `DATE`: Date (YYYY-MM-DD).
          * `DATETIME`: Date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS).
          * `DECIMAL(P, S)`: Exact decimal numbers (P = total digits, S = digits after decimal).

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic SQL Commands (DDL & DML)

SQL (Structured Query Language) is how you interact with your database. We'll cover Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating and modifying the database structure, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) for managing the data itself.

### üìù Data Definition Language (DDL)

These commands define or modify the database schema.

  * **`CREATE DATABASE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To create a new database.
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE database_name;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE my_first_db;
        ```
  * **`USE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To select a database to work with.
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        USE database_name;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        USE my_first_db;
        ```
  * **`CREATE TABLE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To create a new table within the selected database.
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE table_name (
            column1 datatype constraints,
            column2 datatype constraints,
            ...
            PRIMARY KEY (column_name)
        );
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        USE my_first_db; -- Make sure you're in the right database

        CREATE TABLE students (
            student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
            enrollment_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
        );
        ```
  * **`ALTER TABLE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To modify an existing table (add/drop columns, change data types, etc.).
      * **Syntax (Add Column):**
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN new_column_name datatype;
        ```
      * **Example (Add Column):**
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN major VARCHAR(50);
        ```
      * **Syntax (Drop Column):**
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
        ```
      * **Example (Drop Column):**
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN major;
        ```
  * **`DROP TABLE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To delete an existing table. **Use with caution\!**
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        DROP TABLE table_name;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        DROP TABLE students;
        ```
  * **`DROP DATABASE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To delete an entire database. **Use with extreme caution\!**
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        DROP DATABASE database_name;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        DROP DATABASE my_first_db;
        ```

### üì• Data Manipulation Language (DML)

These commands handle the actual data within your tables.

  * **`INSERT INTO`:**
      * **Purpose:** To add new rows (records) into a table.
      * **Syntax (Full Row):**
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
        ```
      * **Syntax (All Columns - order matters\!):**
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        USE my_first_db;
        -- Re-create the table if you dropped it earlier for example
        CREATE TABLE students (
            student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
            enrollment_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
        );

        INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, email)
        VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith', 'alice.smith@example.com');

        INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, email)
        VALUES ('Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob.johnson@example.com');

        INSERT INTO students VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'charlie.brown@example.com', '2024-03-10');
        ```
  * **`SELECT`:**
      * **Purpose:** To retrieve data from one or more tables. This is one of the most frequently used commands\!
      * **Syntax (All Columns):**
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM table_name;
        ```
      * **Syntax (Specific Columns):**
        ```sql
        SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM students;
        SELECT first_name, email FROM students;
        ```
  * **`WHERE` Clause:**
      * **Purpose:** To filter results based on a condition. Used with `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        SELECT columns FROM table_name WHERE condition;
        ```
      * **Operators:** `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=` (or `<>`), `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE` (for pattern matching), `IN` (for multiple values), `BETWEEN` (for a range).
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Alice';
        SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students WHERE enrollment_date >= '2024-01-01';
        SELECT * FROM students WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%'; -- last names starting with 'S'
        ```
  * **`UPDATE`:**
      * **Purpose:** To modify existing data in a table. **Always use with `WHERE` to avoid updating all rows\!**
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        UPDATE table_name SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2 WHERE condition;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        UPDATE students SET email = 'alice.newemail@example.com' WHERE student_id = 1;
        UPDATE students SET enrollment_date = '2024-01-01' WHERE last_name = 'Johnson';
        ```
  * **`DELETE FROM`:**
      * **Purpose:** To remove rows from a table. **Always use with `WHERE` to avoid deleting all rows\!**
      * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```sql
        DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 3;
        DELETE FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Bob';
        ```

## üìà Advanced SQL Concepts (for the next steps)

Once you're comfortable with the basics, these concepts will help you write more powerful queries.

  * **`ORDER BY`:**
      * **Purpose:** To sort the result set.
      * **Example:** `SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY last_name ASC;` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending).
  * **`LIMIT`:**
      * **Purpose:** To restrict the number of rows returned.
      * **Example:** `SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;` (returns the first 5 rows).
  * **`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` (Aggregate Functions):**
      * **Purpose:** To perform calculations on a set of rows.
      * **Example:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;` (total number of students).
      * `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;`
  * **`GROUP BY`:**
      * **Purpose:** To group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. Often used with aggregate functions.
      * **Example:** `SELECT major, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY major;` (count students by major).
  * **`HAVING`:**
      * **Purpose:** To filter groups created by `GROUP BY`. `WHERE` filters individual rows, `HAVING` filters groups.
      * **Example:** `SELECT major, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY major HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;` (only show majors with more than 5 students).
  * **`JOIN`s:**
      * **Purpose:** To combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
      * **Types:**
          * **`INNER JOIN`:** Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
          * **`LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`):** Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there's no match, the right side will have NULLs.
          * **`RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`):** Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If there's no match, the left side will have NULLs.
          * **`FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`):** Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables (MySQL doesn't have a direct `FULL JOIN`, but you can simulate it with `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`).
      * **Example (INNER JOIN):**
        Imagine you have an `employees` table and a `departments` table.
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE departments (
            dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            dept_name VARCHAR(50)
        );

        INSERT INTO departments VALUES (1, 'HR');
        INSERT INTO departments VALUES (2, 'Engineering');

        CREATE TABLE employees (
            emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            emp_name VARCHAR(50),
            dept_id INT,
            FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
        );

        INSERT INTO employees VALUES (101, 'Alice', 1);
        INSERT INTO employees VALUES (102, 'Bob', 2);
        INSERT INTO employees VALUES (103, 'Charlie', 1);
        INSERT INTO employees VALUES (104, 'David', NULL); -- Employee not assigned to a department

        SELECT
            e.emp_name,
            d.dept_name
        FROM
            employees e
        INNER JOIN
            departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
        ```
        This would return:
        ```
        emp_name | dept_name
        -------------------
        Alice    | HR
        Bob      | Engineering
        Charlie  | HR
        ```
