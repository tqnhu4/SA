## üöÄ Advanced Querying Techniques

Mastering these techniques will allow you to extract complex insights from your data.

* **Subqueries:**
    * **What it is:** A query nested inside another SQL query. It can return a single value, a list of values, or a table.
    * **Types:**
        * **Scalar Subquery:** Returns a single value.
        * **Row Subquery:** Returns a single row with one or more columns.
        * **Table Subquery:** Returns a virtual table that can be used in the outer query's `FROM` clause.
        * **Correlated Subquery:** Executes once for each row processed by the outer query.
    * **Example (Scalar Subquery):** Find employees who earn more than the average salary.
        ```sql
        SELECT
            employee_name,
            salary
        FROM
            employees
        WHERE
            salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
        ```
    * **Example (Table Subquery - used in FROM clause):** Find the average salary for each department and then filter departments with an average salary above a certain threshold.
        ```sql
        SELECT
            d.dept_name,
            avg_salary_per_dept.avg_dept_salary
        FROM
            departments d
        INNER JOIN
            (SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_dept_salary FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id) AS avg_salary_per_dept
            ON d.dept_id = avg_salary_per_dept.dept_id
        WHERE
            avg_salary_per_dept.avg_dept_salary > 60000;
        ```
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs - `WITH` Clause):**
    * **What it is:** A named temporary result set that you can reference within a single `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. They improve readability for complex queries, especially those involving subqueries.
    * **Syntax:**
        ```sql
        WITH cte_name AS (
            -- Your subquery here
            SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition
        )
        SELECT * FROM cte_name WHERE another_condition;
        ```
    * **Example:** Calculate the average order value per customer and then find customers whose average order value is above the overall average.
        ```sql
        WITH CustomerAverageOrder AS (
            SELECT
                customer_id,
                AVG(order_total) AS avg_order_value
            FROM
                orders
            GROUP BY
                customer_id
        )
        SELECT
            c.customer_name,
            cao.avg_order_value
        FROM
            customers c
        JOIN
            CustomerAverageOrder cao ON c.customer_id = cao.customer_id
        WHERE
            cao.avg_order_value > (SELECT AVG(order_total) FROM orders);
        ```
* **Window Functions:**
    * **What it is:** Functions that perform a calculation across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions (like `SUM()`, `AVG()`), window functions don't collapse rows; they return a value for each row.
    * **Common Functions:** `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER()`, `AVG() OVER()`.
    * **Syntax:** `function_name() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_name] [ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]])`
    * **Example (`ROW_NUMBER()`):** Assign a unique rank to employees within each department based on their salary.
        ```sql
        SELECT
            employee_name,
            department_id,
            salary,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_in_dept
        FROM
            employees;
        ```
    * **Example (`LAG()`):** Find the difference in sales from the previous month.
        ```sql
        SELECT
            sale_month,
            total_sales,
            LAG(total_sales, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sale_month) AS previous_month_sales,
            total_sales - LAG(total_sales, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sale_month) AS sales_difference
        FROM
            monthly_sales;
        ```
* **`UNION` and `UNION ALL`:**
    * **What it is:** Operators used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements.
    * **`UNION`:** Combines and removes duplicate rows.
    * **`UNION ALL`:** Combines all rows, including duplicates.
    * **Requirements:** Both `SELECT` statements must have the same number of columns, and corresponding columns must have compatible data types.
    * **Example:** Combine a list of active customers and active suppliers.
        ```sql
        SELECT customer_name AS person_name, 'Customer' AS type FROM customers WHERE status = 'Active'
        UNION ALL
        SELECT supplier_name AS person_name, 'Supplier' AS type FROM suppliers WHERE status = 'Active';
        ```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

Making your queries run faster is crucial for large databases.

* **Indexes:**
    * **What it is:** Special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Think of them like the index in a book.
    * **Types:**
        * **Primary Key Index:** Automatically created for primary key columns.
        * **Unique Index:** Ensures all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.
        * **Non-unique Index (B-Tree Index):** The most common type, used for speeding up `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN`s, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
    * **When to use:** On columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, `ORDER BY` clauses, or for enforcing uniqueness.
    * **When *not* to use:** On columns with very few unique values, or on tables that are frequently updated/inserted (indexes slow down write operations).
    * **Example (Create Index):**
        ```sql
        CREATE INDEX idx_employee_lastname ON employees (last_name);
        CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_employee_email ON employees (email);
        ```
    * **Example (Show Indexes):**
        ```sql
        SHOW INDEXES FROM employees;
        ```
* **`EXPLAIN` Command:**
    * **What it is:** A powerful tool to understand how MySQL executes your `SELECT` query. It shows the execution plan, including which indexes are used, how tables are joined, and the order of operations.
    * **How to use:** Prepend `EXPLAIN` to your `SELECT` statement.
    * **Example:**
        ```sql
        EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
        ```
    * **Interpretation:** Look for `type` (e.g., `ALL` means full table scan - bad, `ref` or `eq_ref` means index used - good), `rows` (estimated number of rows examined), `key` (index used), `Extra` (additional information).
* **Query Optimization Best Practices:**
    * **Avoid `SELECT *` in production:** Only select the columns you need.
    * **Use `WHERE` clauses effectively:** Filter as early as possible.
    * **Be mindful of `LIKE '%value'`:** Leading wildcards (`%`) prevent index usage.
    * **Optimize `JOIN`s:** Ensure `ON` conditions use indexed columns.
    * **Limit results (`LIMIT`):** If you only need a few rows.
    * **Avoid complex calculations in `WHERE` clauses:** Do them in the `SELECT` list instead.
    * **Normalize your database (mostly):** Reduce data redundancy, but sometimes denormalization is used for performance in specific scenarios (though this is more advanced).

## üîí Security and Permissions

Securing your database is paramount.

* **User Management:**
    * **What it is:** Creating and managing database users.
    * **Example (Create User):**
        ```sql
        CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
        ```
    * **Example (Drop User):**
        ```sql
        DROP USER 'new_user'@'localhost';
        ```
* **Granting and Revoking Privileges:**
    * **What it is:** Giving specific permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to users on specific databases or tables.
    * **Syntax (Grant):**
        ```sql
        GRANT privilege_type ON database_name.table_name TO 'user'@'host';
        ```
    * **Syntax (Revoke):**
        ```sql
        REVOKE privilege_type ON database_name.table_name FROM 'user'@'host';
        ```
    * **Example (Grant):**
        ```sql
        GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON my_database.employees TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_database.* TO 'admin_user'@'localhost';
        ```
    * **Example (Revoke):**
        ```sql
        REVOKE INSERT ON my_database.employees FROM 'new_user'@'localhost';
        ```
* **Password Policies:**
    * **What it is:** Configuring MySQL to enforce strong passwords (length, complexity).
    * **How to:** Often configured during installation or via MySQL configuration files (`my.cnf`/`my.ini`) and server variables.
    * **Example (Check password policy):**
        ```sql
        SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%';
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stored Programs

Automate and encapsulate logic within the database.

* **Stored Procedures:**
    * **What it is:** A set of SQL statements stored in the database. They can accept parameters and return values. Used for encapsulating business logic, improving performance (pre-compiled), and enhancing security.
    * **Syntax (Basic):**
        ```sql
        DELIMITER //
        CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCountByDept(IN dept_id_param INT, OUT employee_count INT)
        BEGIN
            SELECT COUNT(*) INTO employee_count FROM employees WHERE department_id = dept_id_param;
        END //
        DELIMITER ;
        ```
    * **Example (Call):**
        ```sql
        CALL GetEmployeeCountByDept(1, @count);
        SELECT @count;
        ```
* **Stored Functions:**
    * **What it is:** Similar to stored procedures, but they *must* return a single scalar value. They can be used in SQL expressions (like in `SELECT` or `WHERE` clauses).
    * **Syntax (Basic):**
        ```sql
        DELIMITER //
        CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeFullName(first VARCHAR(50), last VARCHAR(50)) RETURNS VARCHAR(100)
        DETERMINISTIC
        BEGIN
            RETURN CONCAT(first, ' ', last);
        END //
        DELIMITER ;
        ```
    * **Example (Use):**
        ```sql
        SELECT employee_id, GetEmployeeFullName(first_name, last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
        ```
* **Triggers:**
    * **What it is:** Special stored programs that automatically execute (fire) in response to specific events (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on a table.
    * **Syntax (Basic):**
        ```sql
        DELIMITER //
        CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
        BEFORE INSERT ON employees
        FOR EACH ROW
        BEGIN
            IF NEW.salary < 30000 THEN
                SET NEW.salary = 30000; -- Ensure minimum salary
            END IF;
        END //
        DELIMITER ;
        ```
    * **When to use:** For enforcing complex business rules, maintaining audit trails, or ensuring data consistency.
* **Events:**
    * **What it is:** Scheduled tasks that execute at specified times or intervals. Similar to cron jobs but managed within MySQL.
    * **Syntax (Basic):**
        ```sql
        CREATE EVENT clean_old_logs
        ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
        STARTS '2025-01-01 00:00:00'
        DO
            DELETE FROM logs WHERE log_date < CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
        ```
    * **Enable Event Scheduler:** `SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;`
