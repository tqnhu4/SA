# üöÄ Advanced Git Learning Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on advanced Git features that enhance productivity, streamline collaboration, and help manage more complex repository histories.

## ü§ù 1. Handling Merge Conflicts

Conflicts happen when Git can't automatically combine changes from two branches because the same lines of code (or the same file) were modified differently in both branches.

### Scenario

You modify `file.txt` on `main`, and a colleague modifies the *same lines* of `file.txt` on a feature branch. When you merge, a conflict occurs.

### Command & Workflow

1.  **Start the merge:**
    ```bash
    git switch main
    git pull origin main # Ensure your main is up-to-date
    git merge feature-branch
    ```
    Git will report conflicts:
    ```
    Auto-merging file.txt
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    ```
2.  **Identify conflicted files:**
    ```bash
    git status
    # On branch main
    # You have unmerged paths.
    #   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
    #   (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
    #
    # Unmerged paths:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
    #         both modified:   file.txt
    #
    # no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    ```
3.  **Open the conflicted file (`file.txt`)**:
    Git adds "conflict markers" to the file:
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    This is line A from main.
    =======
    This is line B from the feature-branch.
    >>>>>>> feature-branch
    ```
    * `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Marks the beginning of the conflicting change in your current branch (`HEAD`, which is `main` in this case).
    * `=======`: Separates the changes from the two branches.
    * `>>>>>>> feature-branch`: Marks the end of the conflicting change from the incoming branch (`feature-branch`).

4.  **Manually resolve the conflict**: Edit `file.txt` to include the desired changes. Remove the conflict markers.

    *Example Resolution:*
    ```
    This is the resolved line, combining A and B.
    ```
5.  **Stage the resolved file**:
    ```bash
    git add file.txt
    ```
6.  **Commit the merge**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Merge feature-branch into main and resolve conflicts"
    ```

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è 2. Git Rebase

Rebasing is an alternative to merging that allows you to integrate changes from one branch onto another by moving or combining a sequence of commits. It rewrites history, creating a cleaner, linear project history.

### Purpose

* Maintain a clean, linear project history.
* Incorporate upstream changes into your feature branch.

### Scenario

You have a `feature-branch` that diverged from `main`. `main` has new commits, and you want to bring those new `main` commits into your `feature-branch` *before* your feature's changes.

### Command

```bash
git switch feature-branch
git rebase main
```

### Explanation

* `git rebase main`: Takes all the commits from your `feature-branch` that are not on `main`, "saves" them, then moves your `feature-branch`'s base to the tip of `main`, and finally "reapplies" your saved commits on top of the new `main`.

### Example

1.  Assume `main` has commits A, B. `feature-branch` was created from B and has commits C, D.
2.  `main` now has new commits E, F.
    `main`: A -- B -- E -- F
    `feature-branch`: B -- C -- D
3.  Run `git switch feature-branch` then `git rebase main`.
4.  Result:
    `main`: A -- B -- E -- F
    `feature-branch`: A -- B -- E -- F -- C' -- D' (C' and D' are rewritten commits)

**Important**: Never rebase a branch that has been pushed to a public remote repository if other people are working on it, as it rewrites history and can cause major headaches for collaborators.

## üì¶ 3. Git Stash

Temporarily saves changes in your working directory and staging area without committing them, allowing you to switch contexts or address urgent issues.

### Purpose

* Switch branches without committing half-done work.
* Clean your working directory to pull new changes.

### Commands

* **Stash changes:**
    ```bash
    git stash save "Work in progress: fixing styling"
    # Or simply: git stash
    ```
    * `git stash save "message"`: Saves your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) and clears your working directory. The optional message helps identify the stash.

* **View stashes:**
    ```bash
    git stash list
    ```
    * `git stash list`: Shows a list of your stashed changes. Stashes are named `stash@{0}`, `stash@{1}`, etc.

* **Apply a stash:**
    ```bash
    git stash apply stash@{0}
    # Or for the most recent stash: git stash apply
    ```
    * `git stash apply`: Applies the changes from a stash to your working directory but keeps the stash in your stash list. Use `stash@{0}` for the most recent.

* **Apply and drop a stash:**
    ```bash
    git stash pop
    ```
    * `git stash pop`: Applies the changes from the most recent stash and then removes it from the stash list.

* **Delete a stash:**
    ```bash
    git stash drop stash@{1}
    ```
    * `git stash drop`: Removes a specific stash from the stash list.

## üè∑Ô∏è 4. Git Tags

Tags are used to mark specific points in the repository's history as important. They are typically used for marking release points (e.g., v1.0, v2.0).

### Purpose

* Mark releases or important milestones.
* Provide memorable names for specific commits.

### Commands

* **Create a lightweight tag:**
    ```bash
    git tag v1.0
    ```
    * `git tag [tag_name]`: Creates a lightweight tag that simply points to a specific commit.

* **Create an annotated tag (recommended):**
    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
    ```
    * `git tag -a [tag_name] -m "message"`: Creates an annotated tag, which stores the tagger name, email, and date, along with a message. This is more robust and recommended for releases.

* **List tags:**
    ```bash
    git tag
    # Or to see more details for annotated tags:
    git tag -n
    ```

* **Push tags to remote:**
    Tags are not pushed automatically with `git push`.

    ```bash
    git push origin [tag_name]
    # Or to push all tags:
    git push origin --tags
    ```

* **Delete a tag:**
    ```bash
    git tag -d v1.0 # Delete local tag
    git push origin --delete v1.0 # Delete remote tag
    ```

---

## üßπ 5. Git Clean

Removes untracked files from your working directory. Useful for cleaning up a messy repository or after running builds that generate temporary files.

### Purpose

* Remove untracked files and directories.
* Clean up a repository to its pristine state.

### Commands

* **Dry run (show what would be removed):**
    ```bash
    git clean -n
    ```
    * `git clean -n`: Shows you which files would be removed without actually removing them. **Always run this first!**

* **Remove untracked files:**
    ```bash
    git clean -f
    ```
    * `git clean -f`: Removes untracked files from the current directory. `-f` (force) is required as a safety measure.

* **Remove untracked files and directories:**
    ```bash
    git clean -fd
    ```
    * `git clean -fd`: Removes untracked files *and* untracked directories.

---

## üôà 6. Git Ignore

A `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It prevents Git from listing them as untracked and helps keep your repository clean.

### Purpose

* Ignore temporary files (e.g., build artifacts, logs).
* Ignore personal configuration files or sensitive data.
* Keep your `git status` output clean.

### Example `.gitignore` file

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your repository and add patterns:

```gitignore
# Ignored files
.DS_Store
*.log
temp/

# Ignored directories
node_modules/
build/

# Ignored specific file types
*.tmp
*.swp

# Ignored by pattern
*.exe
```

### Explanation

* Lines starting with `#` are comments.
* Blank lines are ignored.
* `temp/`: Ignores the `temp` directory and everything inside it.
* `*.log`: Ignores all files ending with `.log`.
* `!important.log`: Negates a previous pattern; if `*.log` is ignored, `important.log` would still be tracked.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è 7. Git Reflog

The reflog (reference log) records every time your `HEAD` or other references are updated in your local repository. It's a lifesaver for recovering lost commits or branches.

### Purpose

* Recover lost commits or branches.
* See a chronological history of operations in your local repo.

### Command

```bash
git reflog
```

### Explanation

* `git reflog`: Shows a chronological list of actions (commits, merges, rebases, checkouts) that have modified `HEAD`.

### Example

```bash
git reflog
# 0a1b2c3 HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from feature-branch to main
# 4d5e6f7 HEAD@{1}: commit: Add new feature
# 8g9h0i1 HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from main to feature-branch
# j2k3l4m HEAD@{3}: merge feature-branch: Fast-forward
# n5o6p7q HEAD@{4}: pull origin main: Fast-forward
# ...
```

If you accidentally `git reset --hard` to an old commit and "lose" recent work, you can find the commit hash in `git reflog` and then `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` to restore it.

## üöÄ What's Next?

With these advanced Git concepts, you're well-equipped for more complex version control scenarios. To continue your journey, consider exploring:

* **Git Hooks**: Automating tasks before or after Git events.
* **Git Submodules**: Managing external repositories within your own.
* **Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)**: For squashing, reordering, or editing commits.
* **Git Bisect**: Finding the commit that introduced a bug.
* **Git Worktree**: Working on multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories.
* **Advanced Branching Strategies**: Like Git Flow or GitHub Flow.
