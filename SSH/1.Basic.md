# üöÄ Basic SSH Learning Roadmap

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. It's widely used for remote command-line login and executing commands remotely.

## üåü 1. Understanding the Basics

Before diving into commands, let's understand some fundamental concepts.

* **Client-Server Model**: SSH works on a client-server model. Your computer (the client) connects to a remote computer (the server).
* **Encryption**: SSH encrypts all communication between the client and server, protecting your data from eavesdropping.
* **Authentication**: SSH uses various methods to authenticate users, most commonly passwords or SSH keys.
* **Ports**: By default, SSH uses **port 22**.

## üîë 2. Connecting to a Remote Server

This is the most fundamental SSH operation.

### Command

```bash
ssh [username]@[hostname_or_IP_address]
```

### Explanation

* `ssh`: The command to initiate an SSH connection.
* `[username]`: The username you want to log in as on the remote server.
* `[hostname_or_IP_address]`: The hostname (e.g., `example.com`) or IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) of the remote server.

### Example

Let's say your username on the remote server is `admin` and its IP address is `203.0.113.45`.

```bash
ssh admin@203.0.113.45
```

## üîí 3. SSH Authentication Methods

### 3.1. Password Authentication

After executing the `ssh` command, you'll often be prompted to enter the password for the specified user on the remote server.

### Example

```bash
ssh admin@203.0.113.45
# The system will then prompt:
# admin@203.0.113.45's password:
# (Type your password here - it won't show on screen)
```

### 3.2. SSH Key Authentication (Recommended)

SSH keys provide a more secure and convenient way to authenticate. They consist of a **public key** (which you place on the server) and a **private key** (which you keep secret on your local machine).

#### Generating SSH Keys

### Command

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Explanation

* `ssh-keygen`: The command to generate SSH keys.
* `-t rsa`: Specifies the key type as RSA.
* `-b 4096`: Sets the key length to 4096 bits (more secure than the default).
* `-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds a comment to identify the key.

### Example

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myemail@example.com"
# Output will guide you through saving the key and setting a passphrase (optional but recommended for private key).
# Typically, keys are saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa (private) and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public).
```

#### Copying Your Public Key to the Server

### Command

```bash
ssh-copy-id [username]@[hostname_or_IP_address]
```

### Explanation

* `ssh-copy-id`: A utility that copies your public key to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

### Example

```bash
ssh-copy-id admin@203.0.113.45
# You will be prompted for the password for admin@203.0.113.45 once.
# After this, you should be able to log in without a password.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Executing Remote Commands

You can execute a single command on a remote server without logging in interactively.

### Command

```bash
ssh [username]@[hostname_or_IP_address] "[command_to_execute]"
```

### Example

To check the disk usage on the remote server:

```bash
ssh admin@203.0.113.45 "df -h"
```

---

## üìÇ 5. Secure File Transfer (SCP and SFTP)

SSH also provides secure ways to transfer files.

### 5.1. SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

SCP is used to securely copy files between hosts on a network.

#### Copying a Local File to a Remote Server

### Command

```bash
scp [local_file_path] [username]@[hostname_or_IP_address]:[remote_directory_path]
```

### Example

Copy `document.txt` from your local machine to the `documents` folder on the remote server:

```bash
scp document.txt admin@203.0.113.45:/home/admin/documents/
```

#### Copying a Remote File to Your Local Machine

### Command

```bash
scp [username]@[hostname_or_IP_address]:[remote_file_path] [local_directory_path]
```

### Example

Copy `report.pdf` from the remote server to your local `reports` folder:

```bash
scp admin@203.0.113.45:/var/log/report.pdf ~/reports/
```

### 5.2. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

SFTP provides an interactive file transfer program, similar to FTP but secure.

### Command

```bash
sftp [username]@[hostname_or_IP_address]
```

### Explanation

Once connected, you can use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `get`, `put`.

### Example

```bash
sftp admin@203.0.113.45
# Output will be an sftp prompt:
# sftp> ls
# sftp> get /var/www/html/index.html
# sftp> put ~/my_new_file.txt /tmp/
# sftp> exit
```

## üõ°Ô∏è 6. Basic Security Practices

* **Use Strong Passwords**: If using password authentication, ensure they are complex.
* **Use SSH Keys**: Prefer SSH key authentication over passwords.
* **Protect Your Private Key**: Never share your private key. Set a strong passphrase for it.
* **Disable Password Authentication (Advanced)**: For production servers, consider disabling password authentication in the SSH server configuration (`sshd_config`) to only allow key-based logins.
* **Change Default SSH Port (Advanced)**: Changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard one can reduce automated attacks, though it's not a security panacea.

## üöÄ What's Next?

This roadmap covers the basics. To deepen your SSH knowledge, consider exploring:

* **SSH Configuration File (`~/.ssh/config`)**: Learn how to create aliases and set specific options for different hosts.
* **SSH Port Forwarding (Tunneling)**: Understand how to create secure tunnels for other services.
* **SSH Agents**: Manage your SSH keys more efficiently.
* **Disabling Root Login (Security)**: A common security practice for servers.
