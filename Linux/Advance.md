# üöÄ Advanced Linux Learning Roadmap

This roadmap will take your Linux skills beyond basic navigation and file management, delving into system administration, networking, and automation‚Äîessential skills for IT professionals and developers.

## üì¶ 1. Package Management

Learn how to install, update, and remove software efficiently using your distribution's package manager. This is fundamental for managing system software.

### Purpose

* Install new software.
* Update existing packages to their latest versions.
* Remove unwanted software.
* Manage software dependencies.

### Common Package Managers

* **APT** (Advanced Package Tool): Used by Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint.
* **YUM/DNF**: Used by CentOS, RHEL, Fedora.

### Commands (APT Examples)

* **Update package lists:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Downloads the latest package information from the configured repositories. This doesn't update actual software, just the list of available versions.

* **Upgrade installed packages:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Upgrades all installed packages to their newest versions based on the updated lists.

* **Install a new package:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install [package_name]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Installs the specified package and its dependencies.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install nginx
        ```

* **Remove a package:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt remove [package_name]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Removes the specified package, but may leave configuration files behind.

* **Remove a package and its configuration files:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt purge [package_name]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Removes the package along with its configuration files.

* **Clean up unused packages and dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt autoremove
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Removes packages that were installed as dependencies for other packages but are no longer needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Process Management

Understand how to monitor, control, and terminate running programs (processes) on your system.

### Purpose

* Identify resource-intensive processes.
* Terminate unresponsive applications.
* Monitor system health.

### Commands

* **List running processes:**
    ```bash
    ps aux
    ```
    * **Explanation:** `ps` displays information about running processes.
        * `a`: Show processes for all users.
        * `u`: Display user/owner.
        * `x`: Show processes not attached to a terminal.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        ps aux | grep nginx # Find processes related to Nginx
        ```

* **Monitor processes interactively (`top` / `htop`):**
    ```bash
    top
    # Or install and use htop for a more user-friendly interface:
    sudo apt install htop
    htop
    ```
    * **Explanation:** `top` provides a dynamic real-time view of running processes, CPU usage, memory usage, etc. `htop` is a more advanced and interactive version of `top`. Press `q` to quit.

* **Send signals to processes (`kill`):**
    ```bash
    kill [PID]
    kill -9 [PID] # Force kill (use with caution!)
    ```
    * **Explanation:** `kill` sends a signal to a process, identified by its Process ID (PID).
        * Default signal (no option): `SIGTERM` (15) - Asks the process to terminate gracefully.
        * `-9` or `SIGKILL`: Forces the process to terminate immediately. It cannot be ignored by the process.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        # Find PID of a hung process
        ps aux | grep "my_app"
        # Assuming PID is 12345
        kill 12345
        # If it doesn't die
        kill -9 12345
        ```

## üåê 3. Networking Commands

Learn to configure, troubleshoot, and inspect network interfaces and connections.

### Purpose

* Check network connectivity.
* Configure IP addresses and routes.
* Diagnose network issues.

### Commands

* **Display network interfaces and IP addresses (`ip addr` / `ifconfig`):**
    ```bash
    ip addr show
    # Or on older systems (deprecated but still common):
    ifconfig
    ```
    * **Explanation:** `ip addr show` (or `ip a`) displays IP addresses, network interfaces, and their status. `ifconfig` does similar, but `ip` is the modern replacement.

* **Test network connectivity (`ping`):**
    ```bash
    ping [hostname_or_IP]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Sends ICMP echo requests to a target host to check connectivity. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        ping google.com
        ```

* **Display network routing table (`ip route` / `route`):**
    ```bash
    ip route show
    # Or on older systems:
    route -n
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Shows the kernel's routing table, indicating how network traffic is routed.

* **Display active network connections (`ss` / `netstat`):**
    ```bash
    ss -tuln
    # Or on older systems (deprecated but common):
    netstat -tuln
    ```
    * **Explanation:**
        * `ss`: A utility to investigate sockets.
        * `netstat`: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
        * `-t`: TCP connections.
        * `-u`: UDP connections.
        * `-l`: Listening sockets.
        * `-n`: Numeric output (don't resolve hostnames/ports).

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        ss -tuln | grep 80 # Find what's listening on port 80
        ```

* **Check DNS resolution (`dig` / `nslookup`):**
    ```bash
    dig [hostname]
    # Or:
    nslookup [hostname]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Queries DNS name servers to get domain name information. `dig` is generally more powerful and preferred.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        dig example.com
        ```

## üîê 4. System Services and Daemons (Systemd)

Learn how to manage background processes that provide system functionalities (services/daemons) using `systemd`, the most common init system in modern Linux distributions.

### Purpose

* Start, stop, and restart system services.
* Enable/disable services at boot.
* Check service status and logs.

### Commands

* **Check service status:**
    ```bash
    systemctl status [service_name]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Shows the current status of a service (active, inactive, failed), recent log entries, and more.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        systemctl status nginx
        ```

* **Start a service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start [service_name]
    ```

* **Stop a service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop [service_name]
    ```

* **Restart a service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart [service_name]
    ```

* **Reload a service (for configuration changes without full restart):**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl reload [service_name]
    ```

* **Enable a service (start at boot):**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable [service_name]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Creates a symlink to start the service automatically when the system boots up.

* **Disable a service (prevent from starting at boot):**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable [service_name]
    ```

## üìì 5. Logging and Journalctl

Understand how Linux logs system events, errors, and application messages, and how to query them using `journalctl` (for systemd-based systems).

### Purpose

* Troubleshoot system issues.
* Monitor application behavior.
* Review security events.

### Commands

* **View all journal entries:**
    ```bash
    journalctl
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Displays all collected log messages. It behaves like `less`, so you can scroll and search.

* **View journal entries for a specific service:**
    ```bash
    journalctl -u [service_name]
    ```
    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        journalctl -u sshd
        ```

* **View entries since a specific time:**
    ```bash
    journalctl --since "2025-06-17 14:00:00"
    journalctl --since "2 hours ago"
    journalctl -u nginx --since "yesterday" --until "now"
    ```

* **Follow new log entries in real-time:**
    ```bash
    journalctl -f
    journalctl -u nginx -f
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Behaves like `tail -f` for the journal.

* **View kernel messages:**
    ```bash
    journalctl -k
    ```

## üîê 6. User and Group Management (Advanced)

Go beyond basic user creation to manage user accounts, groups, and their permissions more effectively.

### Purpose

* Create and manage system users and groups.
* Control access to files and resources.
* Implement security policies.

### Commands

* **Add a new user:**
    ```bash
    sudo useradd -m [username]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Creates a new user account. `-m` creates the user's home directory.

* **Set/Change user password:**
    ```bash
    sudo passwd [username]
    ```

* **Delete a user:**
    ```bash
    sudo userdel -r [username]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Deletes a user account. `-r` also removes their home directory and mail spool.

* **Add a user to a group:**
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG [groupname] [username]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Adds an existing user to an existing group. `-a` (append) and `-G` (groups) are crucial.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG sudo youruser # Add youruser to the 'sudo' group
        ```

* **Create a new group:**
    ```bash
    sudo groupadd [groupname]
    ```

* **Delete a group:**
    ```bash
    sudo groupdel [groupname]
    ```

* **Change file/directory owner/group recursively:**
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R [owner]:[group] [directory]
    ```
    * **Explanation:** Recursively changes the owner and group of files and subdirectories.

    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
        ```

        * `:wq` or `ZZ`: Save and quit.
        * `:q!`: Quit without saving (force).
        * `x`: Delete character under cursor.
        * `dd`: Delete current line.
        * `yy`: Yank (copy) current line.
        * `p`: Paste.
        * `/search_term`: Search forward.
        * `n`: Next search result.

## ü§ñ 8. Basic Shell Scripting

Automate repetitive tasks and create custom commands. This is where the real power of the Linux command line shines.

### Purpose

* Automate system administration tasks.
* Create custom tools.
* Combine multiple commands into a single executable script.

### Example Script (`backup.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple backup script

BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups"
SOURCE_DIR="/var/www/html"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="${BACKUP_DIR}/web_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.tar.gz"

echo "Starting backup of ${SOURCE_DIR}..."

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Create a compressed tar archive of the source directory
tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" "$SOURCE_DIR"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup successful: ${BACKUP_FILE}"
else
    echo "Backup failed!"
fi

# Clean up old backups (keep last 7 days)
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -mtime +7 -name "web_backup_*.tar.gz" -delete

echo "Old backups cleaned up."
```

### Steps to Run a Script

1.  **Create the file:**
    ```bash
    nano backup.sh
    # Paste the script content. Save and exit.
    ```
2.  **Make it executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x backup.sh
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./backup.sh
    # Or if it's in your PATH:
    backup.sh
    ```
