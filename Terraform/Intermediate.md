## Roadmap to Learning Intermediate Terraform

This roadmap builds upon the foundational knowledge and guides you through more advanced concepts and best practices for building robust and reusable infrastructure with Terraform.

### Intermediate Level: Building Robust and Reusable Infrastructure

This level focuses on best practices, modularity, and managing more complex infrastructure efficiently.

* üì¶ **Terraform Modules:**
    * **Understand the concept of Terraform modules for reusability and organization.**
        * **Example:** Instead of defining an EC2 instance, security group, and elastic IP in one monolithic file, you can create a "web_app" module that encapsulates all these related resources. This promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    * **Create and consume local modules.**
        * **Example (Local Module Structure):**
            ```
            .
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf             # Root configuration file
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf        # Root input variables
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf          # Root outputs
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web_server/     # Your custom module directory
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf
            ```
        * **Example (Calling a Local Module from `main.tf`):**
            ```terraform
            # main.tf (in your root directory)
            module "my_web_app_instance" {
              source        = "./modules/web_server" # Relative path to your module
              instance_type = "t3.small"
              ami_id        = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90" # Example AMI for Amazon Linux 2 (Virginia)
              key_name      = "your-ssh-key-pair"    # Replace with your actual key pair name
              # Add other module-specific variables here
            }

            output "web_app_public_ip" {
              description = "Public IP of the web server from the module."
              value       = module.my_web_app_instance.public_ip # Accessing output from the module
            }
            ```
    * **Explore the Terraform Registry for publicly available modules.**
        * **Example:** Using a pre-built AWS VPC module from the registry:
            ```terraform
            # main.tf
            module "vpc" {
              source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
              version = "3.18.0" # Always pin module versions for consistency

              name = "my-prod-vpc"
              cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

              azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
              private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
              public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24"]

              enable_nat_gateway = true
              single_nat_gateway = true
              enable_vpn_gateway = false

              tags = {
                Environment = "production"
              }
            }
            ```
    * **Hands-on Project:** Refactor your previous simple web server deployment into a reusable module. Create separate `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files inside a `modules/web_server` directory, and then call this module from your root `main.tf`.

* ‚òÅÔ∏è **Remote State Management:**
    * **Learn about remote backends (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage) for storing state in a shared, versioned, and secure location.**
        * **Example (AWS S3 Backend in `main.tf`):**
            ```terraform
            terraform {
              backend "s3" {
                bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket-unique-12345" # Replace with your unique S3 bucket name
                key            = "environments/dev/my-app/terraform.tfstate" # Path to your state file
                region         = "us-east-1"
                dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"                       # Optional: for state locking
                encrypt        = true                                       # Encrypts the state file at rest
              }
            }
            ```
            **Note:** You need to create the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table (if used for locking) manually or with a separate Terraform configuration before using this backend.
    * **Understand state locking for collaborative environments.**
        * **Example:** DynamoDB is often used with S3 for state locking. When one user runs `terraform apply`, a lock is acquired on the state file. If another user tries to run `apply` simultaneously, they will be blocked until the lock is released, preventing concurrent modifications and state corruption.

* üîç **Data Sources:**
    * **Utilize data sources to fetch information about existing infrastructure or external data that is not managed by your current Terraform configuration.**
        * **Example (Get information about a specific Amazon Machine Image - AMI):**
            ```terraform
            data "aws_ami" "ubuntu_focal" {
              most_recent = true
              filter {
                name   = "name"
                values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
              }
              filter {
                name   = "virtualization-type"
                values = ["hvm"]
              }
              owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical's AWS account ID
            }

            resource "aws_instance" "web_server_ubuntu" {
              ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_focal.id # Use the ID from the data source
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
              key_name      = "your-ssh-key-pair"
              # ... other configuration
            }
            ```
    * **Hands-on Project:** Use a data source to retrieve details of an existing VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) by its name or ID, and then deploy a new resource (e.g., an EC2 instance or an RDS database) into a subnet within that VPC.

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Provisioners (Local-exec, Remote-exec):**
    * **Understand when and how to use provisioners for bootstrapping or executing commands on resources after they are created or destroyed. (Note: Often better to use configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or cloud-native user data for long-term configuration management).**
        * **`local-exec` Example (Run a script on the machine where Terraform is executed after instance creation):**
            ```terraform
            resource "aws_instance" "example_server" {
              ami           = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
              key_name      = "your-key-pair"

              provisioner "local-exec" {
                command = "echo 'AWS Instance ${self.id} was created at $(date)' >> instance_creation_log.txt"
              }
            }
            ```
        * **`remote-exec` Example (Run a command on the remote instance after creation, requires SSH access):**
            ```terraform
            resource "aws_instance" "remote_exec_server" {
              ami           = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
              key_name      = "your-key-pair"
              # ... security group allowing SSH ...

              provisioner "remote-exec" {
                inline = [
                  "sudo apt update -y",
                  "sudo apt install -y nginx",
                  "echo 'Hello from remote-exec!' | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html",
                  "sudo systemctl start nginx"
                ]

                connection {
                  type        = "ssh"
                  user        = "ec2-user" # Or 'ubuntu', 'admin', etc., depending on AMI
                  private_key = file("~/.ssh/your-key-pair.pem")
                  host        = self.public_ip
                }
              }
            }
            ```

* ‚ûï **Functions and Expressions:**
    * **Explore built-in Terraform functions (e.g., `lookup`, `concat`, `length`, `cidrhost`, `split`, `join`).**
        * **Example (Using `concat` to combine lists):**
            ```terraform
            locals {
              list_of_dev_ips  = ["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2"]
              list_of_prod_ips = ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"]
              all_allowed_ips  = concat(local.list_of_dev_ips, local.list_of_prod_ips)
              # Result: ["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2", "10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"]
            }

            resource "aws_security_group" "app_sg" {
              # ...
              ingress {
                from_port   = 80
                to_port     = 80
                protocol    = "tcp"
                cidr_blocks = local.all_allowed_ips
              }
            }
            ```
        * **Example (Using `cidrhost` to get a specific IP from a CIDR block):**
            ```terraform
            resource "aws_network_interface" "management_nic" {
              subnet_id       = aws_subnet.private_subnet.id
              private_ips     = [cidrhost("10.0.1.0/24", 5)] # Assigns 10.0.1.5
              # ...
            }
            ```
    * **Understand expressions for dynamic value generation.**
        * **Example:** `"${var.environment}-web-server"` creates resource names like "dev-web-server", "staging-web-server", or "prod-web-server" based on an `environment` variable.

* üîÅ **Conditional Expressions and Loops (`for_each`, `count`):**
    * **Implement conditional logic in your configurations to create or omit resources based on certain conditions.**
        * **Example (Conditional resource creation):**
            ```terraform
            variable "enable_logging_bucket" {
              description = "Set to true to create a dedicated logging bucket."
              type        = bool
              default     = false
            }

            resource "aws_s3_bucket" "log_bucket" {
              count  = var.enable_logging_bucket ? 1 : 0 # Only create if enable_logging_bucket is true
              bucket = "my-app-logs-${var.environment}"
              acl    = "log-delivery-write"
              # ...
            }
            ```
    * **Use `count` to create multiple, identical instances of a resource.**
        * **Example (`count` for scaling identical web servers):**
            ```terraform
            variable "num_web_servers" {
              description = "Number of web servers to deploy."
              type        = number
              default     = 2
            }

            resource "aws_instance" "web_server_array" {
              count         = var.num_web_servers # Creates instances: aws_instance.web_server_array[0], [1], etc.
              ami           = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
              key_name      = "your-key-pair"
              tags = {
                Name = "web-server-${count.index}" # Tags will be "web-server-0", "web-server-1"
              }
              # ... other configuration
            }
            ```
    * **Use `for_each` to create multiple instances of a resource based on a map or set, allowing for unique configurations per instance.**
        * **Example (`for_each` for deploying specific database instances):**
            ```terraform
            variable "database_configs" {
              type = map(object({
                engine_version = string
                instance_type  = string
                allocated_storage = number
              }))
              default = {
                "web_db" = {
                  engine_version = "5.7.mysql"
                  instance_type  = "db.t3.micro"
                  allocated_storage = 20
                },
                "reporting_db" = {
                  engine_version = "9.6.postgres"
                  instance_type  = "db.t3.small"
                  allocated_storage = 50
                }
              }
            }

            resource "aws_db_instance" "app_databases" {
              for_each             = var.database_configs # Iterate over the map keys (web_db, reporting_db)
              engine               = split(".", each.value.engine_version)[1] # Extract 'mysql' or 'postgres'
              engine_version       = each.value.engine_version
              instance_class       = each.value.instance_type
              allocated_storage    = each.value.allocated_storage
              identifier           = "app-${each.key}" # Identifier will be 'app-web_db', 'app-reporting_db'
              username             = "${each.key}_user"
              password             = "Password123!" # In real-world, use Secrets Manager!
              skip_final_snapshot  = true
              # ... other configuration
            }
            ```
    * **Hands-on Project:** Deploy multiple identical web servers using `count` OR deploy multiple, slightly different database instances using `for_each` based on a variable map.

* üóÇÔ∏è **Terraform Workspaces:**
    * **Understand how to use workspaces for managing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) within a single Terraform configuration. Workspaces provide separate state files for each environment.**
        * **Example:**
            ```bash
            # Create a new workspace for development
            terraform workspace new dev

            # Select the 'dev' workspace
            terraform workspace select dev

            # Apply changes to the 'dev' environment
            terraform apply

            # Create a new workspace for production
            terraform workspace new prod

            # Select the 'prod' workspace
            terraform workspace select prod

            # Apply changes to the 'prod' environment
            terraform apply
            ```
            You can then use `terraform.workspace` in your configuration to adjust resource names or settings based on the selected workspace (e.g., `"${terraform.workspace}-my-bucket"`).

* üì¶ **Introduction to Terragrunt (Optional but Recommended):**
    * **Explore Terragrunt as a thin wrapper around Terraform. It helps manage multiple Terraform root modules, enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, handle remote state and inputs more effectively, and promotes a consistent folder structure for large projects.**
        * **Example (Simple Terragrunt `terragrunt.hcl` configuration):**
            ```hcl
            # live/dev/us-east-1/webserver/terragrunt.hcl
            include {
              path = find_in_parent_folders() # Inherit common settings from parent folders
            }

            terraform {
              source = "../../_modules/webserver" # Relative path to your reusable Terraform module

              # Automatically configure S3 backend for this specific deployment
              remote_state {
                backend = "s3"
                config = {
                  bucket         = "my-shared-terraform-states"
                  key            = "dev/us-east-1/webserver/terraform.tfstate"
                  region         = "us-east-1"
                  dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
                  encrypt        = true
                }
              }
            }

            inputs = {
              # Pass inputs to the webserver module
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
              ami_id        = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
              environment   = "dev"
            }
            ```
            Running `terragrunt apply` in this `webserver` directory will fetch the module, configure the remote state, and apply it with the specified inputs. This helps avoid repeating backend and common variable definitions across many Terraform configurations.
